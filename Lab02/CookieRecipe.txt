Chewy Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies - Aubrey Kroger

Ingredients: 
	1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted & slightly cooled
	1/4 cup packed brown sugar
	1/2 cup granulated sugar
	1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
	6 tablespoons pumpkin puree
	1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1/4 teaspoon baking powder
	1/4 teaspoon baking soda
	1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
	3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
	1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 

Instructions: 
	1. Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl until not brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the vanilla and blotted pumpkin until smooth. Set aside. 
	2. Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft. 
	3. Fold in 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them. Cover the dough and chill for 30 minutes or up to 3 days. 
	4. Remove dough from the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. 
	5. Roll the dough into balls, about 1.5 tablespoons of dough each. Using the back of a spoon, slightly flatten the top of the dough balls. 
	6. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set (still very soft in the center). Press a few more chocolate chips into the top of the warm cookies. 
	7. Cool cookies on baking sheets for at a least 10 minutes and then transfer to wire rack. Enjoy!
	Note: Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
